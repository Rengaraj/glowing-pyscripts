## Adivi Sarva Lakshmi Devi

Devi is an independent software consultant and a
trainer with an experience of more than 12 years in the industry. She
has given couple of talks and a workshop at PyCon India before, which
were very well received. She has done M.Tech  in Computational
Science from IISc, before which she tried out teaching mathematics.

She is a consistent and valuable part of Python India community. I
remember PyCon India 2012 when I first met this mom of 2, she was one of
(unfortunately) very few women Python programmer in our community. She
is giving courage to many of us, the women in our community. Now it is
high time that I think we should appreciate her and let all the newbies
and everyone be inspired.

## Sayan Chowdhury

The main reason I propose him is because of his impact on the up and
coming generation as well as his commitment in helping them grow. This
point was driven home when for the DjangoGirls workshop this month,
one of the mentors was one of his students. To inspire and teach
someone to grow and get them to a position where they can help others
is an extremely important and admirable trait.

I don't know if he fits the bill exactly on all the criteria that
Anand Pillai mentioned in one of the earlier emails, but from his own
personal technical open source contributions, to his sincere &
passionate effort in mentoring people, to his approachable attitude
all contributes to a keynote worthy character for mainly the younger
generation of programmers to look up to, communicate with, and learn
from.

Oh yeah, and I recently figured out he is quite an awesome artist too.

He's a maintainer of PyPI, organizer for the PyTexas conference and a
member of the Python Packaging Authority. He's given multiple talks
related to Python and software development in general and would bring
an interesting perspective IMO.
